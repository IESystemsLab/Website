%% Multiple Workstations In Series
% The contents of the *MultipleWorkstationsInSeries* folder within the *ProductionLineModels* folder concern certain 
% results from queueing theory applied to the analysis of a production line.  Of interest here is a "linking equation"
% (equations 8.10-8.11 in Hopp & Spearman, ed. 2) to characterize the departure process of one workstation, which may be
% the arrival process to the next.  This approximation enables extending single-workstation analytical approximations
% for _Work-In-Process_, _Cycle Time_, and _Throughput_ to production lines built of multiple workstations in series.
%
% A natural extension, not implemented at the time of writing, is to implement analytical results for the thinning of a
% Poisson process.  Should the departure process from a single workstation be approximately a Poisson process, then 
% single-workstation analytical approximations for Work-In-Process, Cycle Time, and Throughput could also be extended to
% production lines built of multiple workstations _with parallel branches_.
%
% One contribution in this section is an implementation of these analytical formulas, and an additional contribution
% concerns simulation, specifically a simulation generator to assemble production lines of single workstation library
% blocks in series.
%
% Most importantly, a small number of DEMO scripts is included showing how to use the analytical formulas, the 
% simulation model generator, and both to compare their results.  Each DEMO script is a usage example, an illustration 
% of what is possible, an idea for a lab experiment.  The collection is certainly not exhaustive, and it is hoped that 
% they will inspire users to create more, plus transcribe the good ones into carefully-defined lab experiments for 
% education.  The remainder of this overview summarizes what the included DEMO scripts do.





%% Analytical Approximation:  Multiple Workstations in Series
% The following demo uses the closed-form queueing theory approximations from Hopp & Spearman, 
% chapter 8, plus the linking equation to characterize a single workstation's departure process. 
% Multiple workstations are arranged in series, all with a low processing time variability, 
% _except one with very high variability_.  Of interest is how the relative position of the high-
% variability workstation (e.g. first, middle, last) affects the overall system performance measures
% of work-in-process, cycle time, and throughput.  The expected result is the farther upstream the 
% high-variability workstation resides, the more damaging it is on overall system performance 
% measures.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include interarrival time mean & variability, processing
% time means (one subplot for each) and variability (both the small SCV value for all workstations
% except one, and the large SCV value for the one aberrant workstation), the number of workstations
% in series, and the number of servers at each workstation.

%% Analytical Approximation vs Simulation:  Multiple Workstations in Series
% The following demo compares queueing theory approximations and discrete-event simulation.  It 
% evaluates the performance measures work-in-process, cycle time, and throughput for multiple 
% workstations in series in two different ways: (1) Using closed-form queueing theory approximations
% from Hopp & Spearman, including the linking equation to characterize each workstation's departure 
% process, and (2) Using discrete-event simulation.
%
% Analytical approximations and simulation are compared for an increasing number of workstations in
% series (two, then three, then four, ...).  Evaluation is also over a range of utilizations (with
% each workstation having the same value), because the linking equation is a function of utilization
% and the goal is to evaluate the linking equation's fidelity.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include interarrival time distribution, mean, and
% variability, processing time distribution, means (one subplot for each), and variability, the type
% of single workstations assembled in series (plain vanilla, with preemptive failures, with non-
% preemptive setups, with batching), and each workstation's queue capacity and number of servers.
%
% UPDATE:  The _PARALLEL_ version of this demo supercedes the _SERIAL_ version.  It should produce
% exactly the same results, just much faster.  It introduces parallelization by replacing several 
% nested FOR loops with a single PARFOR loop, which by default will start and use as many background
% MATLAB sessions as your processor has cores.
