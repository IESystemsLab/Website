%% Analytical Approximation:  Behavior of Single Workstation
% The following demo uses the closed-form queueing theory approximations from Hopp & Spearman, 
% chapter 8, to examine how the performance measures work-in-process, cycle time, and throughput 
% respond for a single workstation as various things change - the mean and variance of queue inter-
% arrival times, the mean and variance of server processing times, and the number of servers/ 
% machines/ processors _k_.  Several interesting things can be visualized in the results, including 
% Little's Law, the response of the system to increasing utilization, and the response of the system
% to increasing variability in interarrival or processing times.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include interarrival time mean, interarrival time 
% variance, processing time mean, and processing time variance.

%% Analytical Approximation:  M (Markovian) versus G (General)
% The following demo uses the closed-form queueing theory approximations from Hopp & Spearman, 
% chapter 8, and compares the Markovian case with the General case.  The expected result is that if 
% means and variances for Inter-Arrival times and Processing times have SCVs near one, then the G/G 
% case should match the M/M case.  If at least one SCV is far from one, then the cases should

%% Analytical Approximation vs Simulation:  Preemptive Failures
% Hopp and Spearman offer equations 8.4-8.6 (ed. 2) for _effective_ process time in the case of

% Hopp and Spearman offer equations 8.7-8.9 (ed. 2) for _effective_ process time in the case of
% non-preemptive setups.  However, they derive these formulas by assuming that count-between-setups
% is moderately variable (e.g. the mean and standard deviation are equal, a discrete analog of the

% The purpose of the following demo is to reproduce figure 9.6 in Hopp & Spearman (ed. 2).  The demo
% invokes the simulation model *GGkWorkstation_MakeAndMoveBatches_Parallel* (through its wrapper
% function) over a range of process batch sizes with _parallel_ batch processing.  Any of the
% performance measures [WIP, CT, TH, UTIL] can be plotted against batch size; Hopp & Spearman's
% figure 9.6 shows cycle time, so that is what is generated at the time of writing.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include a range of process batch sizes to sweep over, a
% transfer batch size, the distribution, mean, and variability of interarrival time and processing
% time (parallel processing = for the whole batch), and the number of servers.

% invokes the simulation model *GGkWorkstation_MakeAndMoveBatches_SerialWithSetups* (through its
