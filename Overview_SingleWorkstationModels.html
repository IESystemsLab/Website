%% Analytical Approximation:  Behavior of Single Workstation
% The following demo uses the closed-form queueing theory approximations from Hopp & Spearman, 
% chapter 8, to examine how the performance measures work-in-process, cycle time, and throughput 
% respond for a single workstation as various things change - the mean and variance of queue inter-
% arrival times, the mean and variance of server processing times, and the number of servers/ 
% machines/ processors _k_.  Several interesting things can be visualized in the results, including 
% Little's Law, the response of the system to increasing utilization, and the response of the system
% to increasing variability in interarrival or processing times.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include interarrival time mean, interarrival time 
% variance, processing time mean, and processing time variance.

%% Analytical Approximation:  Multiple Workstations in Series
% The following demo uses the closed-form queueing theory approximations from Hopp & Spearman, 
% chapter 8, plus the linking equation to characterize a single workstation's departure process.

% the single workstation's queue capacity, and its number of servers.

%% Analytical Approximation vs Simulation:  Multiple Workstations in Series
% The following demo compares queueing theory approximations and discrete-event simulation.  It 
% evaluates the performance measures work-in-process, cycle time, and throughput for multiple 
% workstations in series in two different ways: (1) Using closed-form queueing theory approximations
% from Hopp & Spearman, including the linking equation to characterize each workstation's departure 
% process, and (2) Using discrete-event simulation.
%
% Analytical approximations and simulation are compared for an increasing number of workstations in
% series (two, then three, then four, ...).  Evaluation is also over a range of utilizations (with
% each workstation having the same value), because the linking equation is a function of utilization
% and the goal is to evaluate the linking equation's fidelity.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include interarrival time distribution, mean, and
% variability, processing time distribution, means (one subplot for each), and variability, the type
% of single workstations assembled in series (plain vanilla, with preemptive failures, with non-
% preemptive setups, with batching), and each workstation's queue capacity and number of servers.
%
% UPDATE:  The _PARALLEL_ version of this demo supercedes the _SERIAL_ version.  It should produce
% exactly the same results, just much faster.  It introduces parallelization by replacing several 
% nested FOR loops with a single PARFOR loop, which by default will start and use as many background
% MATLAB sessions as your processor has cores.

%% Analytical Approximation vs Simulation:  Preemptive Failures
% Hopp and Spearman offer equations 8.4-8.6 (ed. 2) for _effective_ process time in the case of
% preemptive failures.  However, they derive these formulas by assuming that time-until-failure is 
% exponentially distributed (SCV=1).  Simulation allows arbitrary SCVs, so it can be tested how
% closed-form and simulation results compare when the exponential assumption is relaxed.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include the distribution, mean, and variability of
% interarrival time, processing time, time-until-failure (for this a range of SCVs to sweep over),
% and time-to-repair.

%% Analytical Approximation vs Simulation:  Non-Preemptive Setups
% Hopp and Spearman offer equations 8.7-8.9 (ed. 2) for _effective_ process time in the case of
% non-preemptive setups.  However, they derive these formulas by assuming that count-between-setups
% is moderately variable (e.g. the mean and standard deviation are equal, a discrete analog of the
% exponential distribution).  Simulation allows arbitrary SCVs, so it can be tested how closed-form
% and simulation results compare when the exponential assumption is relaxed.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include the distribution, mean, and variability of
% interarrival time, processing time, count-until-setup (for this a range of SCVs to sweep over),
% and setup time.

%% Simulation:  Demonstrate Parameter Sweeps and Replications
% This is a mechanical script written to demonstrate how to sweep over two variables plus 
% replications, and then visualize the results in a surface plot.  It may be somewhat interesting 
% that one of the swept variables chosen is the single workstation's queue capacity, because any 
% finite value acts as a WIP cap.  Any of the performance measures [WIP, CT, TH, U] can be plotted
% against the two swept variables, and cycle time is the arbitrary choice at the time of writing.

%% Simulation:  Process Batching (_Parallel_ = processing time is for entire batch)
% The purpose of the following demo is to reproduce figure 9.6 in Hopp & Spearman (ed. 2).  The demo
% invokes the simulation model 'GGkWorkstation_MakeAndMoveBatches_Parallel' (through its wrapper
% function) over a range of process batch sizes with *parallel* batch processing.  Any of the
% performance measures [WIP, CT, TH, UTIL] can be plotted against batch size; Hopp & Spearman's
% figure 9.6 shows cycle time, so that is what is generated at the time of writing.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include a range of process batch sizes to sweep over, a
% transfer batch size, the distribution, mean, and variability of interarrival time and processing
% time (parallel processing = for the whole batch), and the number of servers.

%% Simulation:  Process Batching (_Serial_ = processing time is for each element in a batch)
% The purpose of the following demo is to reproduce figure 9.5 in Hopp & Spearman (ed. 2).  The demo
% invokes the simulation model 'GGkWorkstation_MakeAndMoveBatches_SerialWithSetups' (through its
% wrapper function) over a range of process batch sizes with *serial* batch processing and setups
% between batches.  Any of the performance measures [WIP, CT, TH, UTIL] can be plotted against batch
% size; Hopp & Spearman's figure 9.5 shows cycle time, so that is what is generated at the time of writing.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include a range of process batch sizes to sweep over, a
% transfer batch size (which enables choosing with or without lot splitting), the distribution,
% mean, and variability of interarrival time and processing time (serial processing = for each
% entity in a batch), and a deterministic setup time between batches.
