%% Push versus Pull
% The contents of the *PushVsPull* folder concern the control decision of when to release work into

%% Behavior of a WIP-Capped Push System as the WIP Cap Changes
% The following demo sweeps over the WIP Cap in a WIP-Capped production system.  The demo invokes

% satisfy demands immediately upon arrival.  The important difference between this and *ProdSys_MakeToStockPULL_CONWIP*
% is that the feedback loop from system state to the release of orders is removed, and orders are instead 
% released using the same open-loop time-based push paradigm as *ProdSys_MakeToOrderPUSH_optionalWIPCap*.

%% Scenarios in which a CONWIP Pull System Performs Worse than a Push System
% The following demo makes side-by-side comparisons of the _push_ and _pull_ order release
% paradigms.  The demo invokes the simulation models *ProdSys_MakeToStockPUSH* and
% *ProdSys_MakeToStockPULL_CONWIP* (through their wrapper functions), the latter over a range of
% CONWIP amounts.  The output visualizes average work-in-process, cycle time, throughput, and demand 
% backorder level in the two paradigms.  The expected result is that, for a sufficient amount of CONWIP,
% the pull paradigm will out-perform the push paradigm.
%
% Another purpose of this demo is to visualize a scenario in which a pulling CONWIP system
% actually performs worse than a push system.  This is done by visualizing single-replication traces of
% the demand backorder level to see how each system recovers from disruptions.  The expected result is
% that increasing CONWIP level will ensure that a system _will recover at all_ and _will recover
% faster_ from disruptions.  While it may seem straightforward to avoid poorly-performing CONWIP
% scenarios by setting the CONWIP amount sufficiently high, recall that there is also an incentive to
% keep the CONWIP amount low to keep the finished goods inventory level low.  Another
% complication is that a non-stationary demand process may cause a static CONWIP level which is
% sufficiently high in the past to become too low over time.
%
% Parameters which can be changed by a user include demand interarrival times' 
% distribution, mean, and variability, processing times' distribution, mean, and variability at each
% workstation, and a range of CONWIP amounts.  The models use G/G/k workstation library blocks 
% which includes both preemptive failures and non-preemptive setups, and if desired values can be 
% set for time-until-failure, repair time, count-until-setup, and setup time at each workstation.
% In the make-to-stock push model, order interarrival times are set equal in distribution to demand 
% interarrival times; otherwise, the lack of feedback control will lead to a steadily-increasing
% mean shortage or surplus.
